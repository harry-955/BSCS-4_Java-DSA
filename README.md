## Learn Basic Data Structures in JAVA
<br>
You can get basic knowledge of array, queue, linked list, hashset, binary trees and graphs etc.
<br> Some practice questions are also attached in order to understand better

## Getting Started
If you are using local terminal for compilation of java files, use following commands
- `To Compile` : javac *.java => This will compile all files of a specific package at a time
- `To Run` : java -cp .. packageName.ClassName  => This will run specific class file (should have main method)
- `Example` : To Run MenuLL from linkedList package use ->  java -cp .. linkedList.menuLL

Skip it if you are using any other IDE. Source files are in src folder, you can simply go there and explore.
<br> Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.


> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
